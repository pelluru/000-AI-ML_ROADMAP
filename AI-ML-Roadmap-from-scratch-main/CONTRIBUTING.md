## Creating a Pull Request

Here's a step-by-step guide on creating a pull request:

1. **Fork this repository:**

   - Visit this repository's URL: https://github.com/aadi1011/AI-ML-Roadmap-from-scratch
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
   - You can directly edit on your GitHub Web and submit a pull request **(skip to step 6)** or edit on your local machine (continue with step 2)

2. **Clone your forked repository to your local machine:**

   - You'll need Git installed on your system. If you don't have it, follow the installation instructions from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
   - Open a terminal and use the `git clone` command to clone your forked repository. Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AI-ML-Roadmap-from-scratch.git
     ```

   - This creates a local copy of the repository on your machine.

3. **Make your changes:**

   - Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor.
   - Make your edits to the `README.md` file, adding your new resources or suggesting changes to existing ones.

4. **Commit your changes:**

   - In your terminal, navigate to the cloned repository directory using `cd`:

     ```bash
     cd AI-ML-Roadmap-from-scratch
     ```

   - Use Git to add your modified files to the staging area:

     ```bash
     git add README.md
     ```

   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message using `git commit`:

     ```bash
     git commit -m "Added new resource on Deep Learning"
     ```

     Replace "Added new resource on Deep Learning" with a clear message that reflects your contribution.

5. **Push your changes to your forked repository:**

   - Push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```
     
6. **Create a pull request:**

   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub `https://github.com/<your-username>/AI-ML-Roadmap-from-scratch`.
   - Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
   - Click the green "New pull request" button.
   - You'll see a comparison between your branch and the main branch of the original repository.
   - Add a clear and concise title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you made.
   - Click the "Create pull request" button to submit your request.
